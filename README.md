hotdeploy
=========
Hotdeploy is a tool for importing content and templates into polopoly. It implements features for keeping track of updated content files etc. that have now been implemented in the Polopoly product. For this reason Hotdeploy is now considered to be legacy and its use is discouraged even for older versions of Polopoly since it will make upgrading hard. Newer versions of Polopoly (10.4 and beyond) should definitely not be using Hotdeploy as it will conflict with the import-scanner introduced in 10.4.
